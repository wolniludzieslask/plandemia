At this time, only the Pfizer-BioNTech/COMINARTY vaccine is authorized for individuals aged 16-17 years.    Previous booster recommendations have included anyone 18 and over who received their second Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose at least six months ago and anyone 18 and over who received a Johnson and Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine at least two months ago.    Dr. Alexia Harrist, state health officer and state epidemiologist with WDH, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated the booster recommendations following authorization by the federal Food and Drug Administration.    “While booster recommendations continue to evolve, we also continue to encourage eligible adults and children to say yes to free, safe and effective vaccination if they haven’t already,” Harrist said. “COVID-19 vaccines continue to offer protection against COVID-19, including the variants. Vaccines are especially good at helping to prevent severe illness.”    Severe illness means that a person with COVID-19 may need hospitalization, intensive care, a ventilator to help them breathe or they may even die.    Youth ages 12 and older are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine and children ages 5-11 are eligible for a dose of the Pfizer vaccine meant for that age group if they haven’t yet been vaccinated.    All COVID-19 vaccine doses, including boosters, continue to be offered at no cost.    Convenient ways to find where to get COVID-19 vaccines include:    Visit govor vacunas.gov online to search and find vaccine sites.  Text your ZIP codeto 438829 (GETVAX) or 822862 (VACUNA) to find up to three nearby locations that have vaccines available.  Call the National COVID-19 Vaccination Assistance Hotline at 1-800-232-0233 for phone-based help.  More than 76,000 Wyoming adults have already received a third dose of either a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.    Harrist noted it is considered safe to get a flu shot and a COVID-19 vaccine dose at the same time.

As of November 12, 2021, CMC updated its guidance as follows:  - unvaccinated staff will undergo required routine testing  - visitation is allowed for all residents at all times in any location  - recommendations for unvaccinated residents, such as not conducting visits in a room/wearing face masks/avoiding physical touch, but no restrictions    Overall, this update relaxes several of the previous restrictions and requirements. However, since unvaccinated staff will still be required to be tested routinely, we will continue differentiated coding with 2G for unvaccinated to reflect this difference.

Per a March 10 update, there are no longer differentiated requirements based on vaccination status, though there are recommendations as follows:  ""While we strongly encourage everyone to be up-to-date with all recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses, the facility must permit visitation regardless of the visitor’s vaccination status (if the visitor(s) has not had a positive viral test, does not report COVID-19 symptoms or meet the criteria for quarantine). There are ways facilities can and should take extra precautions, such as hosting the visit outdoors, if possible; creating dedicated visitation space indoors; permitting in-room visits when the resident’s roommate is not present; and the resident and visitor should wear a well-fitting mask (preferably those with better protection, such as surgical masks or KN95), perform frequent hand hygiene, and practice physical distancing. Some other recommendations include:   • Offering visitors surgical masks or KN95 masks.   • Restricting the visitor’s movement in the facility to only the location of the visit.   • Not conducting visits in common areas (except those areas dedicated for visitation).   • Increasing air-flow and improving ventilation and air quality.   • Cleaning and sanitizing the visitation area after each visit.   • Providing reminders in common areas (e.g., signage) to maintain physical distancing,   perform hand-hygiene, and wear well-fitting masks. "" This will now be coded as undifferentiated 1G to reflect general sanitation, hygiene, and distancing recommendations.
