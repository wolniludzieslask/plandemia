Many other school districts, including in the highly populated cities of Mobile and Birmingham, have yet to reopen.   web.archive.org/web/20200820155615/https://www.al.com/news/2020/08/first-schools-reopen-in-alabama-this-week-many-more-scrambling-changing-plans.html  For a list of school district reopening dates and methods, see: web.archive.org/web/20200820160047/https://www.al.com/news/2020/07/reopening-alabamas-k-12-schools-here-are-the-plans-so-far.html",1.00,1,,1.00,1,,0.00,,,0.00,,,1.00,1,,0.00,,,0.00,,1.00,0,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,3.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,112737,1974,29.63,29.63,45.24,45.24,41.67,41.67,45.83,45.83,12.50,12.50

They have not released the number of cases associated with the school, due to privacy concerns. The school is one of several forced to close soon after reopening, including one that closed August 17 for an initial four days and then extended its closure through the 28th, with 43 students and 10 teachers out for COVID related reasons.    Local media reports indicate many other school districts that have reopened are suffering from an increase in cases and quarantines for students and staff. It also appears that social distancing and mask policies are not being followed, especially in relation to the high school football season.

The new prioritization for vaccination that begins February 8 includes a large group--persons age 65 and above. In addition, workers listed here meet eligibility criteria:  Healthcare workers  First responders including EMS, firefighters and law enforcement  Frontline essential workers as follows:  -- Corrections officers  -- Food and agriculture workers  -- U.S. Postal Service workers  -- Manufacturing workers  -- Grocery store workers  -- Public transit workers  -- People who work in the education sector  -- Childcare workers  -- Judiciary  Dates, times, locations and other details about the sites are available by clicking on alabamapublichealth.gov/covid19vaccine/mass-clinics.html  Hospitals playing a lead role in the mass clinics next week have been working on their plans for the past week, including informing their communities about this opportunity. Due to limited supply of vaccine, every hospital has maintained a waiting list of individuals interested in being vaccinated.  For the sites that will require appointments next week, hospitals have been busy working their way through those waiting lists to schedule appointments for next week’s mass clinics. Some hospitals have 5,000 - 10,000 or more people on waiting lists, so while there may not be appointments available in some areas next week, individuals will continue to be added to their lists and those people will be contacted as soon as another supply of vaccine is available in that area. These vaccination clinics are not replacing vaccinations occurring in other locations in these areas but are being held in addition to them.  The Alabama Department of Public Health wants to administer vaccine to all Alabamians who desire vaccine. However, the supply of vaccines remains very limited. Multiple county health departments have no vaccine available. Plans can change if more vaccine becomes available.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210205200513/https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/news/2021/02/05.html",2.00,1,,,,1,,1,,75-79 yrs,75-79 yrs,0,0,1,2,5,,0,,469319,8449,29.63,29.63,45.24,45.24,36.88,36.88,40.36,40.36,12.50,12.50

The duration of the Program will depend on the number of eligible applicants...  Program funds may be used to provide up to fifteen (15) months of assistance for the following expenses:    Past due rent: rental arrears may be eligible starting March 13, 2020  Rent: future rent for up to three months*  Utilities: includes water, sewer, trash, power, internet and home energy (separately stated expenses related to occupancy of a dwelling such as propane or fuel oil) costs  Costs for telephone, cable, or satellite television are NOT eligible under this program  *While applicants may be assisted for up to 15 months, the Program will not commit funds for prospective (future) rent for more than a 3-month period at a time.

The program is administered through the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As part of this relief package, the State of Alabama/AHFA received approximately $263 million to administer the state entity program, Emergency Rental Assistance Alabama.

It contains recommendations for schools based on the CDC Back to School guidelines to ensure that school administrators and school nurses have the best health guidance to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and keep students and staff safely in school. Implementing universal masking and social distancing, as well as vaccinating when age-appropiate, is suggested since following these guidelines implies that no quarantine is required when a student has been exposed. However the final decision is on local schools.   The overall goal of the Alabama Department of Public Health is that all students return to school safely. However, according to Alabama's COVID-19 Schools K-12 Dashboard updated on 16 September 2021, schools continue to operate on a mixture of in-person, virtual and blended basis.

The CDC has released its new community level graphics which are determined by looking at hospital beds being occupied by COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 hospital admissions, and new COVID-19 cases in an area. Each county’s community level is ranked weekly as low, medium, or high.    Alabama’s COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard will reflect these new measures as soon as possible. In addition, the dashboard will only be updated Monday through Friday instead of daily.    With increasing levels of vaccination and high levels of population immunity from both vaccination and infections, CDC notes that the risk of medically significant disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 is greatly reduced for most people. At the same time, some people and communities, such as the elderly, people who are immunocompromised, and people with disabilities, are at higher risk for serious illness and face challenging decisions navigating a world with COVID-19.    Vaccines are highly protective against severe disease, and continuing to expand vaccine coverage and ensuring people are up to date with vaccination is essential to protecting individuals against hospitalizations and deaths.    COVID-19 community levels do not change the guidance for healthcare settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes. Instead, healthcare settings should continue to use levels of community transmission and follow CDC’s infection prevention and control recommendations for healthcare workers.    Take precautions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 based on the COVID-19 Community Level in your area.    These prevention steps should be taken when the level is low (green): Stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines and get tested if you have symptoms.    If the level is medium (yellow): If you are at high risk for severe illness or are immunocompromised, talk to your healthcare provider about whether you need to wear a mask and take other precautions, stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines and get tested if you have symptoms.    If the level is high (orange): Wear a mask indoors in public, stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, get tested if you have symptoms. Additional precautions may be needed for people at high risk for severe illness.

The numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are declining, knowledge of the virus has grown, safe and effective vaccines are available to eligible people ages 5 and older in the United States, most Alabamians have some immunity either from vaccines or past infection, testing is widely available, and several new oral antiviral treatments and a pre-exposure prophylaxis for the immunocompromised are now authorized. The solid red high-risk map indicating overall level of community transmission seen over the past 2 months in the state is now colored in the low, moderate, or substantial risk levels in a majority of counties, and the percent positivity in tests is under 10. As we enter our third year battling COVID-19, more than half of the state’s population is fully vaccinated.  Is it now safe to return to our pre-COVID lifestyles and resume normal activities? That is a million-dollar question.    All viruses mutate, and new variants continue to be identified, such as the highly infectious BA.2 subvariant of the Omicron variant. As COVID-19 restrictions around the world are ending, there is a possibility another seasonal surge will occur.    From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we knew that people with certain medical conditions were more likely to become very sick from COVID-19. Those at greater risk include people who are elderly, immunocompromised, and who are living with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and HIV. Individuals with disabilities and those experiencing homelessness are also at higher risk. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its information to include physical inactivity as a risk factor for severe illness with COVID-19.    The CDC has long recognized that the conditions in which people live, learn, work, and play contribute to their health. These conditions, over time, lead to different levels of health risks, needs, and outcomes among some people in certain racial and ethnic minority groups. In Alabama, many African Americans and members of other racial and ethnic minority groups live in low-income communities, have less access to healthcare services, and have higher instances of chronic disease. These and other social and socioeconomic risk factors contribute to disproportionately higher risks of morbidity and mortality related to COVID-19.    It is disappointing that Alabama remains the state with the lowest percentage of people fully vaccinated for COVID-19, and sad that more than 18,000 Alabamians have now died due to COVID-19. These sobering facts underscore the need for people to be cautious and protect the vulnerable in our state by judiciously masking indoors around people whose vaccination status is unknown and protecting the immunocompromised.    The CDC emphasizes that living with COVID-19 requires us to use the knowledge we have gained in the past 2 years about ways to protect ourselves and others from COVID-19. Vaccination and boosters remain the leading method of preventing severe disease and deaths from COVID-19; people who are up to date on vaccines and boosters have markedly lower risks than unvaccinated people. While the virus will continue to circulate, we are encouraged that we have more effective tools and learned experience to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 than ever before. Remember to protect those at high risk by keeping up to date on your vaccinations and following preventive measures to reduce COVID-19 disease.  https://archive.ph/4FMhh",3.00,,1.00,,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,"On March 2nd,The news about the Coronavirus Disease 2019 is very hopeful now that COVID-19 is moving in the right direction again.

This program is an initiative of Governor Ivey and the Alabama Legislature to provide support to Alabama’s volunteer fire departments impacted by the covid-19 pandemic.    “Alabama’s first responders, including our community’s volunteer fire departments, are vital in keeping our state safe. While states across the country and the entire globe dealt with the curveballs the pandemic threw, our volunteer fire departments kept going,” said Governor Ivey. “I am proud to have worked with the Alabama Legislature to direct these funds to good use as our local volunteer fire departments recover. I am pleased to support them and encourage them to take advantage of this grant program.”    The state of Alabama will offer grants in an amount up to $10,320 for providers that meet eligibility requirements. The application period for the Alabama Volunteer Fire Department COVID Recovery Grant program will be open from noon, March 7 through noon, March 25, 2022.    Alabama received $2.1 billion in ARPA funds, and the Alabama Legislature appropriated $136,796,346 from Alabama’s State Fiscal Recovery Revenue Replacement Fund for this program.  https://archive.ph/6MRLL",2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,0,,1286655,18569,41.67,41.67,49.52,49.52,47.92,47.92,51.19,51.19,25.00,25.00
