At NUTS II level was just a name change in "Lisboa" which became known as "Área Metropolitana de Lisboa".<br>The analysis of the data for the year 2013 should take into account the changes in the territorial boundaries of the municipalities of Lisboa, Loures, Santarém, Golegã, Faro and Loulé, arising from the legislation related to the administrative territorial reorganization of parishes, with entry into force on September 30, 2013.

(3) The total number of deaths may not correspond to the sum of the partial figures by sex, due to the existence of records with unknown sex.
